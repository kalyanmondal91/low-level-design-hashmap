# HashMap - Low level system design
Repository for low level system design of a HashMap

## Problem Statement
We have to do low level design for a HashMap.

Example:
* map.put(1, "One");
* map.put(2, "Two");
* map.put(3, "Three");
* map.put(4, "Four");
* map.get(2);


### Expectations
* Code should be functionally correct.
* Code should be modular and readable. Clean and professional level code.
* Code should be extensible and scalable. Means it should be able to accommodate new requirements with minimal changes.
* Code should have good OOPs design.
